# Welcome to Joey’s Blog

Hi,

Welcome to my blog, a place where I share my learning, experiences and thoughts. There may not be a focus of topic, but generally should not escape these fields: IT (or Computer Science), Photography and Videography, Travelling, Mathematics, Natural Science and Philosophy.

This is my first time publish my writing to the general public. Please [email me](mailto:joey.teng.dev@gmail.com) if you have anything you would like to discuss with me :)

Hope you enjoy!

Joey

P.S. Name “Joey” has no link to religion. It just happens to be like my former name in terms of pronunciation :D
